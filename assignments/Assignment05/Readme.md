# Fried Potato Competition


his project involves analyzing a dataset containing demographic information of 1,000 individuals. The primary goal is to extract insights and create visualizations using Python libraries.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

- `User Id`: Unique identifier for each individual.
- `First Name` and `Last Name`: Personal information.
- `Sex`: Gender of the individual (Male or Female).
- `Email` and `Phone`: Contact details.
- `Date of birth`: Birth date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `Job Title`: Occupation of the individual.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The data is provided in CSV format with structured entries for each individual.
2. **Data Preparation**: Steps include cleaning missing or invalid data, formatting dates, and verifying data consistency.
3. **Visualization**: Charts and graphs (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs) are created to summarize data distribution (e.g., gender, age groups, job titles).

## Research Goals
- Visualize the gender distribution of individuals in the dataset.
- Analyze the distribution of job titles to understand popular professions.
- Create age group categories to examine demographic trends.

## Scientific Basis
Demographic data analysis relies on statistical and visualization techniques. By categorizing and visualizing data, trends and patterns in population metrics become clearer, providing insights for further analysis.
