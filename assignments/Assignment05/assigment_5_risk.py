# Risk of going hungry simmulation

"""
Since the topic of troops and wars is currently causing me anxiety and stress, and as a result,
the loss of inspiration to solve this particular problem, with your permission, 
I would like to choose a different essence of the program, let's say it will be a competition between 
two food establishments for the preparation of fried potatoes. 
I hope this will not be counted as a mistake or incorrect completion of the task.
