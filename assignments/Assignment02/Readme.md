# Weather Analysis Research

This task involves analyzing weather data, including key metrics such as temperature, wind direction, relative humidity, and other meteorological parameters. The primary goal is to examine temperature trends over time using the available dataset.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is obtained from an automated weather monitoring system, likely utilizing **WeatherLink** as its software type. It includes timestamped entries (`reportStartDateTime`) and weather metrics, with a focus on temperature (dry-bulb temperature), which serves as the primary variable for plotting trends.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The data is provided in CSV format and contains records over a specific time period.
2. **Data Preparation**: Prior to plotting, the data undergoes cleaning to handle missing or incorrect values. Timestamps are converted into a consistent and analyzable format.
3. **Visualization**: A temperature-over-time plot is created to identify trends, variations, and extremes. The **Matplotlib** library is used to ensure high-quality visual representation of the data.

## Research Goals
- Demonstrate temperature changes over time and identify potential trends.
- Validate the quality of the data and processing methods to create a clear graphical representation.

## Scientific Basis
Weather analysis relies on standard meteorological principles and time-series analysis methods. Dry-bulb temperature is one of the most common indicators for assessing atmospheric conditions. Identifying trends in temperature data can be useful for forecasting and studying climate changes.
